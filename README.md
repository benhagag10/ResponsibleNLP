# Fairness and Responsible NLP Resources

Welcome to the **Fairness and Responsible NLP** repository! This is a curated collection of papers, datasets, and resources related to fairness, transparency, and ethical considerations in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to provide a centralized space for researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts to find relevant materials and contribute to this growing field.
